## Color Models

**CMYK** (Subtractive)

- Used in paintings and print media
- Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and 'Key'
- Represented in percentages of values mixed
- _subtractive_ because the more colors mixed the darker the values become
- Converting to CMYK from RGB will lose color range

**RGB** (Additive)

- Red, Green & Blue
- Numeric values between 0 - 255
- _additive_ because the more colors mixed the lighter the values become
- 0, 0, 0 creates a colorless black shape; the associated CMYK values are each set to 100.
- 150, 150, 150 creates a shade of black (grey)
  - When all three values are the same it will create a shade of black (grey)
  - The higher the values become the lighter and brighter the color becomes until 255, 255, 255 is reached or white. The associated CMYK values are each 0
- **Do all digital processing in RGB.  Start and Save as RGB**

**What is a color profile?** A setting determined on a device, used to interpret color space or gamut of the device. The range of colors available is set in the color profile.

## Histogram

The histogram is a visual representation of tonal values within the image.

- The danger triangle indicates the image is using cached data. Click the triangle to clear the cache.

### Low Key

- Image is one that is under exposed or has all the tonal values heavy to the left of the histogram. The _lower_ the values the darker the image.
  - Dark, mysterious, powerful feeling

### Hi Key

- Image has the values of the histogram heavy on the right making the image very bright, light and over exposed feeling with a lot of whites represented.
  - bright, intense, delicate, fragile feeling

### Average Key

- Images have a good spread across all tonal values of the histogram and are desirable.

Most digital cameras have a histogram built in and you should use it...to achieve the lighting and results that you are after. Shoot for _average key_ for most situation for the most option in post image processing
